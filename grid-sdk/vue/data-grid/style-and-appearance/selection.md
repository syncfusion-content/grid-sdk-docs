# Selection in Vue Grid component

You can customize the appearance of the selection in the [Vue Data Grid](https://www.syncfusion.com/vue-components/vue-grid) component using CSS. Here are examples of how to customize the row selection background, cell selection background, and column selection background.

## Customizing the row selection background

To customize the appearance of row selection, you can use the following CSS code:

```css

.e-grid td.e-selectionbackground {
    background-color: #00b7ea;
}
```
In this example, the **.e-selectionbackground** class targets the background color of the row selection. You can modify the `background-color` property to change the background color of the selected rows.
