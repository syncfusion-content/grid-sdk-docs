# Column spanning in Vue TreeGrid

The column spanning feature in the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue TreeGrid allows merging adjacent cells horizontally, creating a visually appealing and informative layout. By defining the `colSpan` attribute in the [queryCellInfo](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/treegrid/index-default#querycellinfo) event, cells can be easily spanned and the appearance of the TreeGrid can be customized.

In the following example, Employee **Davolio** is scheduled for analysis from "9.00 AM" to "10.00 AM", so those cells have been spanned.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid-sdk/vue/treegrid/columns/column-spanning-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid-sdk/vue/treegrid/columns/column-spanning-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/grid-sdk/vue/treegrid/columns/column-spanning-cs1" %}

## Limitations

Column spanning in the Vue TreeGrid has the following limitations:

* The [updateCell](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/treegrid/index-default#updatecell) method does not support column spanning.
* Column spanning is not compatible with the following features:
    1. Virtual scrolling
    2. Infinite scrolling

> When using column spanning, ensure that the spanned cells do not interfere with TreeGrid operations such as sorting, filtering, or editing, as this may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Column spanning via API

The column spanning feature in the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue TreeGrid allows automatically merging cells with identical values in the same row across consecutive columns. This significantly enhances readability and delivers a cleaner layout by eliminating repetitive data such as "Status", "Permit Status", "Inspection Status" and "Punch List Status".

To enable column spanning, set the `enableColumnSpan` property to `true` in the Tree Grid configuration.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid-sdk/vue/treegrid/columns/column-spanning-cs2/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid-sdk/vue/treegrid/columns/column-spanning-cs2/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/grid-sdk/vue/treegrid/columns/column-spanning-cs2" %}

> In the sample, column spanning is disabled at the column level for the price based columns such as "Planned Budget" and "Actual Spend" by setting each column's `enableColumnSpan` property to `false`.
