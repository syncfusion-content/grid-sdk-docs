# Accessibility in React TreeGrid

The TreeGrid follows accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles), which are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the TreeGrid component is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The TreeGrid component follows [WAI‑ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treegrid/) patterns. The following ARIA attributes are used in the TreeGrid component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=treegrid` | Used to convey a significant and contextual message. |
| `aria-selected` | Reflects the selection state for single or multiple selection. |
| `aria-expanded` | Indicates whether a hierarchical row is expanded or collapsed. |
| `aria-sort` | Conveys the current sort direction for a column. |
| `aria-busy` | Announces a loading state while data is being processed. |
| `aria-invalid` | Indicates that the current input value is invalid. |
| `aria-grabbed` | Provides accessibility information for interacting with draggable elements |
| `aria-owns` | Establishing relationships between an element and the elements it owns or controls |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the close icon. |

## Keyboard interaction

The TreeGrid follows the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treegrid/) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported.

## Ensuring accessibility

Accessibility is validated using automated tools such as [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core). The following sample demonstrates TreeGrid accessibility. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/tree-grid.html) in a new window to evaluate accessibility with these tools.
