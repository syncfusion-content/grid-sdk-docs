## Setup for local development

To set up a React application, choose between two popular tools: **Vite** or **create-react-app**.

**Vite is recommended** for new projects because it provides:
- **Faster development server**: Vite uses native ES modules during development, resulting in significantly faster startup times and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) compared to traditional bundler.
- **Smaller bundle sizes**: Optimized production builds with less overhead.
- **Better performance during development**: Especially valuable when working with large component libraries like Syncfusion.
- For detailed steps, refer to the [Vite installation guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Vite sets up your environment using JavaScript and optimizes your application for production.

**create-react-app** remains a valid choice when a traditional setup is preferred, organizational requirements exist, or an existing create-react-app project is in use. For more information, refer to the [create-react-app documentation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/getting-started/create-app).

To create a new React application, run one of the following commands based on your preferred language:

***React with JavaScript***

```
npx create-vite@latest my-app --template react
```

***React with TypeScript***

```
npx create-vite@latest my-app --template react-ts
```

During the setup process, the CLI will prompt you for a few configuration options. Select the following:

- **Which linter to use?** → **ESLint**
- **Install with npm and start now?** → **Yes**

Selecting **Yes** automatically installs the project dependencies and starts the development server.

After verifying that the application starts successfully, terminate the development server in the terminal and proceed to the next step.

Then, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd my-app
```

## Adding Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React Tree Grid packages

To install the Tree Grid component, use the following command:

```
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-react-treegrid --save
```

## Adding CSS reference

Themes for Syncfusion® React Tree Grid component can be applied using CSS files provided through [npm theme packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2-tailwind3-theme). For available themes, refer to the [Themes](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/appearance/theme) documentation.

Install the **Material 3** theme package using the following command:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="npm" %}

npm install @syncfusion/ej2-material3-theme --save

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Then add the following CSS reference to the **src/App.css** file:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight css tabtitle="App.css" %}

@import "../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-material3-theme/styles/treegrid/index.css";

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Adding Tree Grid component

The tree grid code should be placed in the **src/App.tsx** file.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="App.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid-sdk/react/treegrid/getting-started/app/App.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="App.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid-sdk/react/treegrid/getting-started/app/App.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight css tabtitle="App.css" %}
{% raw %}

@import "../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-material3-theme/styles/treegrid/index.css";

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/grid-sdk/react/treegrid/getting-started-cs1" %}

## Run the application

```
npm run dev
```

## Registering Syncfusion license

The Syncfusion® React Tree Grid requires a valid license key to be registered in the application. To prevent license validation warnings, refer to the [Syncfusion licensing](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/licensing/overview) documentation.

## Troubleshooting

- **Grid not rendering styles:** Ensure the theme CSS is imported in `App.css` and that you removed the default Vite CSS in `index.css`.
- **Trial license warning banner:** Register a license key via `registerLicense()` from `@syncfusion/ej2-base`.
