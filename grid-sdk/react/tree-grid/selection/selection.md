# Selection in React TreeGrid

Selection highlights a row or a cell. Selection can be performed using mouse click/drag or arrow keys. To disable selection in the TreeGrid, set [allowSelection](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/#allowselection) to **false**.

For a quick overview of selection, refer to the following video:

Two selection types are available and can be configured using [selectionSettings.type](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/selectionSettings/#type):

* **Single** (default): Allows selection of a single row or cell.
* **Multiple**: Allows selection of multiple rows or cells.

For multi-selection, hold Ctrl key and click the desired rows or cells. To select a contiguous range, hold Shift key and click the start and end targets.

## Selection mode

TreeGrid supports three selection modes configured via [selectionSettings.mode](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/selectionSettings/#mode):

* **Row** (default): Selects rows only.
* **Cell**: Selects cells only.
* **Both**: Allows selecting rows and cells at the same time.

## Touch interaction

On touch devices, tapping a row selects it. A floating menu ![Multi Row selection](../images/selection.jpg) enables multi-row selection. To select multiple rows or cells, tap the menu ![Multi Row or Cells](../images/mselection.jpg), then tap the desired targets.

> Multi-selection requires [selectionSettings.type](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/selectionSettings/#type) set to **Multiple**.

The following screenshot illustrates touch selection on a device.
