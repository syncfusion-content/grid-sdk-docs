# Cell selection in React Treegrid component

Cells can be selected using mouse drag or arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).

TreeGrid provides two cell selection modes configured through [selectionSettings.cellSelectionMode](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/selectionSettings/#cellselectionmode):


* **Flow** (default): Select range of cells between the start index and end index which includes in between cells of rows.
* **Box** - Select range of cells within the start and end column indexes which includes in between cells of rows within the range.
