# Row spanning in React TreeGrid 

The row spanning feature in the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React TreeGrid allows merging cells in the same column vertically, creating a visually appealing and informative layout. By defining the `rowSpan` attribute in the [queryCellInfo](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/index-default#querycellinfo) event, cells can be easily spanned and the appearance of the TreeGrid can be customized.

In the following demo, the **Lunch Break** cell spans multiple rows in the "1:00 PM" column.

{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid-sdk/react/treegrid/row-spanning-cs1/app/App.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Limitations

Row spanning in the React TreeGrid has the following limitations:

* The [updateCell](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/index-default#updatecell) method does not support row spanning.
* Row spanning is not compatible with the following features:
    1. Virtual scrolling
    2. Infinite scrolling

> When using row spanning, ensure that the spanned cells do not interfere with TreeGrid operations such as sorting, filtering, or editing, as this may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Row spanning implementation through API

The Syncfusion React TreeGrid provides an API-based approach to vertically merge cells with identical values in the same column across consecutive rows.

The row spanning feature in the Syncfusion React TreeGrid can be enabled using `enableRowSpan` property to **true** in the TreeGrid configuration, which significantly enhances readability and delivers a cleaner layout by eliminating repetitive data in columns such as "Status", "Permit Status", "Inspection Status" and "Punch List Status".

{% highlight js tabtitle="app.jsx" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid-sdk/react/treegrid/row-spanning-cs2/app/App.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

> In the sample, row spanning is disabled at the column level for the price based columns such as "Planned Budget" and "Actual Spend" by setting each column's `enableRowSpan` property to **false**.
