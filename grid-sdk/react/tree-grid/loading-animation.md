# Loading animation in React TreeGrid

TreeGrid displays a loading indicator while data is fetched and bound during initial rendering, refresh operations, and after actions such as sorting or filtering.

Two indicator types are supported and configured with the `loadingIndicator.indicatorType` property: `Spinner` or `Shimmer`. The default is `Spinner`.

In the following sample, the `Shimmer` indicator is shown while the TreeGrid loads and refreshes with remote data.
