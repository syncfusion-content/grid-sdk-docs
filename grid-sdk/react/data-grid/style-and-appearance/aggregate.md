# Aggregate Style in React Data Grid

The appearance of aggregate elements in the React Data Grid component can be customized using CSS. Below are examples for customizing the aggregate root element and the aggregate cell elements.

## Customizing the aggregate root element

The `.e-gridfooter` class is used to style the aggregate root element in the grid footer.

```css
.e-grid .e-gridfooter {
    font-family: cursive;
}
```
