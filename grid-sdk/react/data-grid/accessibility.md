# Accessibility in the React Grid Component

The [React Data Grid](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-data-grid) component follows major accessibility guidelines and standards, including the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), and [WAI‑ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria#roles). These standards ensure the grid is usable with assistive technologies and keyboard‑only navigation. 

The sections below describe the grid's accessibility compliance and behavior.

<div><img src="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/documentation/full.png" alt="Yes"> - All features of the component meet the requirement.</div>

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The React Grid follows the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/) grid pattern to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies. The following attributes and roles are used throughout the component:

| Attribute / Role | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| `role=grid` | Identifies the container element of the grid. |
| `role=row` | Represents a row containing grid cells. |
| `role=rowgroup` | Represents a logical grouping of rows. |
| `role=columnheader` | Identifies header cells that describe a column. |
| `role=gridcell` | Defines an individual grid cell. |
| `role=button` | Represents button elements inside the grid. |
| `role=search` | Identifies a search region, the toolbar search control. |
| `role=presentation` | Indicates elements that are ignored by assistive technologies (used for layout-only elements). |
| `role=navigation` | Identifies the pager navigation region. |
| `aria-colindex` | Defines the column index relative to total columns. |
| `aria-rowindex` | Defines the row index relative to total rows. |
| `aria-rowspan` | Indicates how many rows a cell spans. |
| `aria-colspan` | Indicates how many columns a cell spans. |
| `aria-rowcount` | Specifies the total number of rows. |
| `aria-colcount` | Specifies the total number of columns. |
| `aria-selected` | Indicates the selection state of a row or cell. |
| `aria-expanded` | Indicates the expanded or collapsed state in hierarchical grids. |
| `aria-sort` | Indicates ascending or descending sort order. |
| `aria-busy` | Indicates that an element is being updated. |
| `aria-owns` | Defines contextual relationships between parent and child elements. |
| `aria-hidden` | Hides elements from assistive technologies. |
| `aria-labelledby` | Provides an accessible name for specific elements such as filter dialog items. |
| `aria-describedby` | Provides descriptive help text for focused header cells. |

The React Data Grid uses a two‑table structure for header and content rendering. This improves screen reader interpretation but may trigger warnings in automated accessibility tools. These warnings do not necessarily affect actual assistive-technology usability. Known checker tool warnings include:

* aria-required-children: This warning can occur when the grid renders certain feature elements (for example, textarea or toolbar content). It may be reported when toolbar or grouping features are enabled.

* color-contrast: This warning can appear when the toolbar search item or custom styles reduce text contrast below WCAG thresholds.

* An explicit ARIA 'role' is not valid for `<tr>` element within an ARIA role 'grid' per the ARIA in HTML specification.

* An explicit ARIA 'role' is not valid for `<th>` element within an ARIA role 'grid' per the ARIA in HTML specification.

* An explicit ARIA 'role' is not valid for `<td>` element within an ARIA role 'grid' per the ARIA in HTML specification.

* The element with role "button" contains descendants with roles "rowgroup" which are ignored by browsers.

* Content is not within a landmark element.

* Multiple elements with "search" role do not have unique labels.

* Text contrast of 4.10 with its background is less than the WCAG AA minimum requirements for text of size 13px and weight of 400.

* Interactive component with ARIA role 'grid' does not have a programmatically associated name.

* The element with role "rowgroup" is not contained in or owned by an element with one of the following roles: "grid, table, treegrid". 

## Keyboard interaction

The Grid provides keyboard navigation and follows WAI‑ARIA [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert#keyboardinteraction) guidelines. Some keyboard behaviors vary depending on which features are enabled; consult the compatibility table above and the examples below for specific behavior.

> * For instance, after swapping the keys, to group the columns when the header element is focused, use <kbd>Command + Space</kbd>, and to expand the visible groups, use <kbd>Ctrl + Down Arrow</kbd>.

### Preventing default key actions

The React Data Grid provides the capability to disable the default key action behavior according to your needs.

This allows the application to intercept and modify the response when specific keys are pressed within the web interface.

To disable the default key action in the grid, use the [keyPressed](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/grid/index-default#keypressed) event.

This allows the application to intercept and modify the response when specific keys are pressed within the web interface.

### Custom shortcut keys

The React Data Grid component allows improving the usability of keyboard shortcuts for various grid actions and navigation.

Besides the built-in keyboard navigation features, custom keyboard shortcuts can be created to perform specific tasks.

Use the [keyPressed](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/grid/index-default#keypressed) event of the grid to achieve this. This event triggers on every key press, enabling customization of the response according to the key pressed.

The example below illustrates how to use shortcut keys to perform grid actions via the `keyPressed` event. Define the following custom shortcuts within the event to execute different grid actions:

* Pressing N adds a new record.
* Pressing Ctrl + S saves a record by calling `endEdit`.
* Pressing Ctrl + D deletes a record.
* Pressing Ctrl + A selects all rows.
* Pressing Ctrl + G groups the grid by a selected column.

Additionally, the default actions for these keyboard shortcuts related to grouping and editing are prevented:

* Ctrl + Space
* Insert
* F2
* Delete
* Enter

Additional custom shortcuts and actions can be added as needed to enhance the capabilities of the React Data Grid component.

## Ensuring Accessibility

The accessibility standards of the Grid component are verified using the software tools [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) during automated testing.

The compliance of the Grid component with accessibility requirements is demonstrated in the example below. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/grid.html) in a new window to assess the Grid component's accessibility using appropriate tools.
{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="App.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid-sdk/react/grid/ensuring-accessibility/app/App.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="App.tsx" %}
