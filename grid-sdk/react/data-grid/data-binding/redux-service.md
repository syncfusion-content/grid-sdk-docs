# Redux service in React Grid Component

The [React Data Grid](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-data-grid) component provides support for integrating data from a Redux service using the [observable binding](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/grid/data-binding/data-binding#custom-binding) feature. This allows the grid component to connect to the [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) store and perform various data operations such as sorting, filtering, paging, and CRUD actions. This section explains the process of enabling and integrating the Redux service with the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React Grid.

## Steps to create a Redux service.

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**

In a terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required packages:

```
npm install --save redux react-redux
```
The above command installs the redux package, which is the core Redux library, and the react-redux package, which provides integration between Redux and React.

**Step 2: Set Up Redux Store**

Once the dependencies are installed, set up a Redux [store](https://redux.js.org/api/store) in the application. Add the following code to the **store.tsx** file.

1. Create a new file called **store.tsx** in the project's directory.

2. In the **store.tsx** file, import the necessary Redux functions and create the store:
    ```ts
    import { createStore } from 'redux';
    import reducer from "../reducer";
    const store = createStore(reducer);
    export default store;
    ```
    In the above code, the `createStore` function from the `redux` package and the `reducer` from the appropriate file are imported. The Redux `store` is created using `createStore`, passing the `reducer` function.

  3. The Redux store is now set up. It can be customized by adding middleware, enhancers, or other configurations as needed.

**Step 3: Connect Redux Provider**

To make the Redux `store` available to React components, wrap the application with the Redux [Provider](https://react-redux.js.org/api/provider) component. It accepts the Redux `store` as a prop and connects the components in its hierarchy. Follow these steps to connect the Redux provider:

1. Open the root component file (usually **index.tsx**).

2. Import the necessary dependencies:

    ```ts
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
    import store from './store';
    ```
3. Wrap the application component with the `Provider` component and pass the Redux `store` as a prop:

    ```ts
    ReactDOM.render(
      <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
      </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root'));
    ```

**Step 4: Create a Actions**

According to Redux documentation, the Redux [actions](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers#designing-actions) are plain JavaScript objects that describe changes to be made to the application's state. These actions are dispatched to the Redux `store`, and `reducers` handle them to update the state accordingly.

The action type defines the name of the action that will be performed in the application. Each action type is a string that describes the specific operation.

Here's an example of a Redux action definition for the sort operation. Add the code to the **action.tsx** file.

```ts
  export const Grid_Sorting = "Grid_Sorting";

  // Action for sorting
  export const sortRow = (state: any , query: any) => ({
    //the necessary parameters for the sort operation
    type: "Grid_Sorting",
    payload: state,
    gridQuery: query
  });
```

**Step 5: Create a Reducer**

According to Redux documentation, Redux [reducers](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers#writing-reducers) are functions responsible for handling actions and updating the application's state. Reducers specify the way the state changes in response to actions dispatched to the Redux `store`.

The following example demonstrates a Redux reducer definition for sorting operations. The reducer code can be added to the **reducer.tsx** file.

```ts
// The page size can also be configured based on application requirements.
const initialPage = { skip: 0, take: 12 }
const initialState: any = {
  data: data,
  error: false,
  result: [],
  count: 0,
}

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  const dataSource = [...initialState.data];
  const gridData = new DataManager(dataSource);
  // we execute the Data Grid action and perform CRUD by using the DataManager. 
  switch(action.type) {
    case Grid_Sorting: {
      // we have executed grid query using DataManager.
      const sortData = gridData.executeLocal(action.gridQuery);
      //Execute the grid page query based on the configured skip and take values.
      const currentPageData = new DataManager(sortData).executeLocal(new Query().skip(action.payload.skip).take(action.payload.take));
      // The grid data should be returned as the result and count with the object type.
      return ({
        data: { result: currentPageData, count: sortData.length }
      })
    }
    default: {
      // The grid data should be returned as the result and count with the object type.
      const defaultCount = state.data.length;
      const defaultData = { data: { result: state.data.slice(initialPage.skip, initialPage.take), count: defaultCount } }
      return defaultData;
    }
  }
}
export default reducer;
```
> The grid expects an object as `result` and `count` format.

**Step 6: Create a Dispatch**

According to Redux documentation, the [dispatch](https://redux.js.org/api/store#dispatchaction) function is a method provided by the Redux `store`. It is used to send actions to the `store`, triggering the state update process. Dispatching an action is the primary way to update state in a Redux application.

When performing actions such as adding, updating, or deleting a row in the Grid, the corresponding actions are dispatched to modify the data in the `store` and trigger updates to the Grid component.

When the [dataSourceChanged](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/grid/index-default#datasourcechanged) and [dataStateChange](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/grid/index-default#datastatechange) events occur, the `dispatch` method is called according to the Grid actions.

Add the following code to **App.tsx** file.

```ts
  const dataStateChange = (args: DataStateChangeEventArgs) => {
    // This event will be triggered when performing any grid action.
    if (args.action.requestType === 'sorting') {
      dispatch(sortRow(state, query));    
    }
  }

  const dataSourceChanged = (state: DataSourceChangedEventArgs) => {
    // This event will be triggered when performing any grid action.
    if (state.requestType === 'delete') {
      dispatch(deleteRow(state, query));
    }
  }
```

**Step 7: Fetching Grid Data using useEffect**

To fetch grid data and populate the [dataSource](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/grid/index-default#datasource) property of the grid, the [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) hook in React can be used. The `useEffect` hook allows side effects, such as fetching data, to be performed after the component has rendered. The following example demonstrates fetching grid data using useEffect:

Add the following code to the **App.tsx** file.

```js
  useEffect(() => {
    if (gridInstance) {
      gridInstance.dataSource = state.data
    }
  }) 
```

## Handling Paging, Filtering, and Sorting

The [dataStateChange](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/grid/index-default#datastatechange) event is triggered when performing Grid actions such as sorting, paging, or grouping. The query associated with the Grid action can be obtained in the `dataStateChange` event. The following example shows Redux `action` and `reducer` code for handling data operations. Add the following code to **App.tsx** file.

```ts
  const dataStateChange = (args: DataStateChangeEventArgs) => {
    // This event will be triggered when performing any grid action.
    const query = gridInstance.getDataModule().generateQuery(true);
    if(args.action){
      // Dispatch the filtering query.
      if (args.action.requestType === 'filtering') {
        dispatch(filterRow(args, query));
      }
      // Dispatch the sorting query.
      if (args.action.requestType === 'sorting') {
        dispatch(sortRow(args, query));    
      }
      // Dispatch the paging query.
      if (args.action.requestType === "paging" || args.action?.requestType === "refresh" || args.action.requestType === "delete") {
        dispatch(pageRow(args, query));
      }
    }
  }
```

The action takes the necessary parameters for the Grid operation and returns an action object with the properties - `type`, `payload`, and `gridQuery`.

The `type` property is set to the corresponding Grid action type constant defined earlier. 

The `payload` property contains the Grid data associated with the action, such as data to be created, updated, or deleted.

The `gridQuery` property is sent along with the data request for each Grid action.

Add the following code to **action.tsx** file. 

```ts
export const Grid_Paging = "Grid_Paging";
export const Grid_Filtering = "Grid_Filtering";
export const Grid_Sorting = "Grid_Sorting";

// Action for filtering
export const filterRow = (state: any , query: any) => ({
    type: "Grid_Filtering",
    payload: state,
    gridQuery: query
});
// Action for sorting
export const sortRow = (state: any , query: any) => ({
    type: "Grid_Sorting",
    payload: state,
    gridQuery: query
});
// Action for paging
export const pageRow = (state: any , query: any) => ({
    type: "Grid_Paging",
    payload: state,
    gridQuery: query
});
```

In this demo, execute the Grid action and perform paging, filtering, and sorting operations using the `DataManager`.

The `executeLocal` method executes a local query on the "gridData" object and `store` the response to this query.

Then, create a new instance of `DataManager` with the "gridData" array as its data source and execute a local query on the "currentPageData" object using `executeLocal` method.

The default value for the Grid's `pageSize` parameter (skip: 0, take: 12) is used to set the `skip` and `take` values. 

Fetch the current page records and the total number of records from the `dataSource` using the properties `result` and `count`. 

Add the following code to **reducer.tsx** file. 

```ts
const initialPage = { skip: 0, take: 12 }
const initialState: any = {
  data: data,
  error: false,
  result: [],
  count: 0,
}

const reducer = (state = initialState, action: any) => {
  const dataSource = [...initialState.data];
  let filter = [];
  const gridData = new DataManager(dataSource);
  if (action.gridQuery !== undefined) {
    filter = action.gridQuery.queries.filter((fn: any) => {
      return fn.fn === "onWhere"
    })
  }
  switch(action.type) {
    case Grid_Filtering: {
      // Here, we have executed the grid query by using the DataManager.
      const filterData = gridData.executeLocal(action.gridQuery);
      // Execute the grid page query based on the configured skip and take values.
      const currentPageData = new DataManager(filterData).executeLocal(new Query().skip(action.payload.skip).take(action.payload.take))
      // We need to return the Grid data as result and count with object type.
      return ({
        data: { result: currentPageData, count: filterData.length }
      })
    }
    case Grid_Sorting: {
      // Execute the grid sort query...
      const sortData = gridData.executeLocal(action.gridQuery);
      // Execute the grid page query based on the configured skip and take values.
      const currentPageData = new DataManager(sortData).executeLocal(new Query().skip(action.payload.skip).take(action.payload.take));
      // We need to return the Grid data as result and count with object type.
      return ({
        data: { result: currentPageData, count: sortData.length }
      })
    }
    case Grid_Paging: {
      // we have executed the grid query by using DataManager.
      const pageData = gridData.executeLocal(new Query());
      // Execute the grid query except pagination....
      const result = action.gridQuery !== undefined ? new DataManager(pageData).executeLocal(action.gridQuery) : pageData;
      // Execute the grid page query based on the configured skip and take values.
      const currentPageData = new DataManager(result).executeLocal(new Query().skip(action.payload.skip).take(action.payload.take));
      // We need to return the Grid data as result and count with object type.
      return ({
        data: { result: currentPageData, count: filter.length ? result.length : pageData.length }
      })
    }         
    default: {
      // We need to return the Grid data as result and count with object type.
      const defaultCount = state.data.length;
      const defaultData = { data: { result: state.data.slice(initialPage.skip, initialPage.take), count: defaultCount } }
      return defaultData;
    }
  }
}
export default reducer;
```

## Performing CRUD operations

To perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in the React Data Grid component, utilize the [dataSourceChanged](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/grid/index-default#datasourcechanged) event. This event is triggered when a CRUD action is performed in the Grid, allowing capture of the changes and updating of the Redux `store` or performing other necessary operations.

The following example shows Redux `action` and `reducer` code for handling CRUD operations. Add the following code to **App.tsx** file.

```ts
  const dataSourceChanged = (state: DataSourceChangedEventArgs) => {
    // This event will be triggered when we perform a CRUD action.
    const query = gridInstance.getDataModule().generateQuery(true);  
    if (state.requestType === "save") {
      // Dispatch the adding action.
      if (state.action === "add") {
        dispatch(addRow(state, query));
      }
      // Dispatch the editing action.
      else if (state.action === "edit") {
        dispatch(updateRow(state, query));
      }
    }
    // Dispatch the deleting action.
    if (state.requestType === 'delete') {
      dispatch(deleteRow(state, query));
    }
  }
```

Add the following code to **action.tsx** file.

```ts
export const Grid_Add = "Grid_Add";
export const Grid_Editing = "Grid_Editing";
export const Grid_Delete = "Grid_Delete";

// Action for adding
export const addRow = (state: any , query: any) => ({
    type: "Grid_Add",
    payload: state,
    gridQuery: query
});
  
// Action for deleting
export const deleteRow = (state: any , query: any) => ({
    type: "Grid_Delete",
    payload: state,
    gridQuery: query
});

// Action for editing
export const updateRow = (state: any , query: any) => ({
    type: "Grid_Editing",
    payload: state,
    gridQuery: query
});
```

The "insert", "update", and "delete" methods should be used to add, update, and remove records. The current page records and the total record count can then be retrieved from the dataSource using the result and count formats.

Add the following code to **reducer.tsx** file.

```ts
const initialPage = { skip: 0, take: 12 }
const initialState: any = {
    data: data,
    error: false,
    result: [],
    count: 0,
}

const reducer = (state = initialState, action: any) => {
  const dataSource = [...initialState.data];
  let filter = [];
  const gridData = new DataManager(dataSource);
  if (action.gridQuery !== undefined) {
    filter = action.gridQuery.queries.filter((fn: any) => {
      return fn.fn === "onWhere"
    })
  }
  switch(action.type) {      
    case Grid_Add: {
      // Here, we will perform the insert action using the DataManager.
      gridData.insert(action.payload.data, '', undefined, 0);
      const addedData = gridData.executeLocal(new Query());
      // Update the original state.
      initialState.data = [...addedData];
      const count = addedData.length;
      const result = new DataManager(addedData).executeLocal(action.gridQuery);
      // Execute the grid page query based on the configured skip and take values.
      const currentPageData = new DataManager(result).executeLocal(new Query().skip(action.payload.state.skip).take(action.payload.state.take));
      // We need to return the grid data as result and count with object type.
      return ({
        data: { result: currentPageData, count: filter.length ? result.length : count },
      })
    }
    case Grid_Editing: {
      // Here, we are going to perform update action by using the DataManager.
      gridData.update('OrderID', action.payload.data);
      const updatedData = gridData.executeLocal(new Query());
      initialState.data = [...updatedData];
      const count = updatedData.length;
      const result = new DataManager(updatedData).executeLocal(action.gridQuery);
      // Execute the grid page query based on the configured skip and take values.
      const currentPageData = new DataManager(result).executeLocal(new Query().skip(action.payload.state.skip).take(action.payload.state.take));
      // We need to return the grid data as result and count with object type.
      return ({
        data: { result: currentPageData, count: filter.length ? result.length : count }
      })
    }
    case Grid_Delete: {
      // Here, we will perform the delete action by using DataManager.
      gridData.remove('OrderID', { OrderID: action.payload.data[0]['OrderID'] });
      const updatedData = gridData.executeLocal(new Query());
      initialState.data = [...updatedData];
      const count = updatedData.length;
      const result = new DataManager(updatedData).executeLocal(action.gridQuery);
      // Execute the grid page query based on the configured skip and take values.
      const currentPageData = new DataManager(result).executeLocal(new Query().skip(action.payload.state.skip).take(action.payload.state.take));
      // We need to return the grid data as result and count with object type.
      return ({
        data: { result: currentPageData, count: filter.length ? result.length : count }
      })
    }
    default: {     
      // We need to return the grid data as result and count with object type.
      const defaultCount = state.data.length;
      const defaultData = { data: { result: state.data.slice(initialPage.skip, initialPage.take), count: defaultCount } }
      return defaultData;
    }
  }
}
export default reducer;
```

Add the following code to **index.tsx** file.

```ts
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import store from './store'

const container = document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);

root.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
```
