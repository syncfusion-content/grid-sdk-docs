# Load desired report from list as default in React Pivot Table

By default, the Pivot Table displays with the report configuration defined in the component initialization. To load a specific report from a previously saved report collection during the initial rendering process, configure the desired report name within the [`dataBound`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/index-default#databound) event. This approach allows the Pivot Table to automatically apply the selected report's configuration, including field arrangements, filters, and formatting settings, as soon as the component completes its data binding process.
