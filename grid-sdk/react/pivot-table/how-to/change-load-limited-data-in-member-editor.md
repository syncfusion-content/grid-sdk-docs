# How to limit member editor data in React Pivot Table

## Overview

When working with large datasets in the React Pivot Table component, loading all field values in the filter dialog's member editor can cause performance issues. The [`maxNodeLimitInMemberEditor`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/index-default#maxnodelimitinmembereditor) property allows you to set a limit on the number of field values displayed initially, improving the loading performance while still providing access to all data through search functionality.

## Setting the data limit

The [`maxNodeLimitInMemberEditor`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/index-default#maxnodelimitinmembereditor) property determines how many field values are loaded initially in the member editor. By default, this property is set to 1000 items.

When the number of field values exceeds this limit:
- Only the specified number of values will load initially
- A message appears indicating how many additional values are available
- Users can use the search option to find specific values from the complete dataset

> This property is available in both pivot table and field list components.

## Implementation example

In the following example, the limit of data in the member editor is set to 100. As a result, the member editor for the `ProductID` field displays only its first 100 members; the remaining 900 members are reachable through the search option.
