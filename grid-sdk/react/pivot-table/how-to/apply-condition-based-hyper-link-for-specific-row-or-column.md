# Apply condition based hyper link for specific row or column in React

In the Pivot Table, you can display hyperlinks in specific rows or columns by setting up certain conditions. This can be done using the [`conditionalSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/hyperlinkSettingsModel/#conditionalsettings) property, which is available within the [`hyperlinkSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/hyperlinkSettings/) object.

The following options are available under the [`conditionalSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/hyperlinkSettingsModel/#conditionalsettings) to configure the hyperlinks:

*   [`label`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/conditionalSettingsModel/#label): Defines the specific row or column header where the hyperlink should appear.
*   [`conditions`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/conditionalSettingsModel/#conditions): Sets the condition type, such as `Equals`, `GreaterThan`, or `LessThan`.
*   [`value1`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/conditionalSettingsModel/#value1): Sets the starting value for the condition.
*   [`value2`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/conditionalSettingsModel/#value2): Sets the ending value for the condition (used for `Between` and `NotBetween` conditions).
*   [`measure`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/conditionalSettingsModel/#measure): Defines the measure, or value field, to which the hyperlink should be applied.

In the following example, the [`hyperlinkSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/hyperlinkSettings/) property is configured to show a hyperlink for cells under the **Germany** header. The hyperlink will only appear if the cell's value is greater than 500. This is achieved by setting the [`label`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/conditionalSettingsModel/#label) to **Germany**, the [`conditions`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/conditionalSettingsModel/#conditions) to **GreaterThan**, and [`value1`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/pivotview/conditionalSettingsModel/#value1) to **500**.
